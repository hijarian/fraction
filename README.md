# JB TDD training exercise 1
## Fractions

This is the example library to test-drive our skills in TDD.

The goal is to make a library to handle the rational numbers exactly, i. e. work with numbers like 2/3, 34/19 and the like.
Set of operations to be supported is adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing.

Code is PHP conforming to [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md)
and has a test suite based on [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de).

Testsuite is to be run like this:

    cd $PROJECT_ROOT_DIR
    phpunit
